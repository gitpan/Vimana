Vimana

Vimana is an easy to use system for searching , installing, and downloading vim
script.

Vimana provides a command-line interface such like C<aptitude> programe on
Debian linux, for you to search , download , install , upgrade scripts from
L<http://www.vim.org> (vimonline site).

Vimana can install a vim script package to your vim runtime path automatically
by inspecting the content of archive file or vim script. for example , if an
archive file contains 'syntax','plugin','indent' directory , then these files
should be installed to F<~/.vim/> directory.   if it's a vim color scheme ,
then it should be put into F<~/.vim/colors/> and prompt for setting the
installed colorscheme as default.

We plan to provide port files via git repository, vimrc customization and
internationalization in future.

( In some modern Indian languages, vimāna or vimān means "aircraft". )

NOTE: Vimana only provides search,info,install commmands currently.
