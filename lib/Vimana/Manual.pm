=head1 NAME

Vimana::Manual - Getting started 

=head1 INTRODUCTION

Vimana provides varied kinds of installation strategy. 

To install a vim plugin, Vimana downloads the file from vim.org , then detects
the downloaded file type.

if the downloaded file is a Vimball script, Vimana calls Vim to run the Vimball
script to install. if it's a colorscheme or syntax file , then copy the
files into your ~/.vim/colors/ or ~/.vim/syntax/ directory.

If it's an archive file (zip, bzip,rar .. etc) , Vimana looks into the archive
file, see if it contains a 'Makefile' file, then use the Makefile file to
install a plugin.

if it doesn't contain a 'Makefile' file.  Vimana looks into the directory tree, 
see if it contains 'doc','plugin','syntax' directories and vim scripts, 
if so , copy these files into your vim runtime directory recursively.

* if the downloaded file is not a Vimball script and not a colorscheme or syntax
file and doesn't contains a Makefile file or 'doc','plugin','syntax',
Vimana will ask you to install the plugin manually.
