Vimana
======

Vimana is an easy to use system for searching , installing, and downloading vim
script.

Vimana provides a command-line interface such like aptitude program on
Debian linux, for you to search , download , install , upgrade scripts from
http://www.vim.org (vimonline site).

Vimana can install a vim script package to your vim runtime path automatically
by inspecting the content of archive file or vim script. for example , if an
archive file contains 'syntax','plugin','indent' directory , then these files
should be installed to ~/.vim/ directory.   if it is a vim color scheme ,
then it should be put into ~/.vim/colors/ and prompt for setting the
installed colorscheme as default.

vimball is supported.

In future, Vimana will support Makefile,Rakefile install. and Vim package meta
file (for VIM::Packager).

( In some modern Indian languages, vimāna or vimān means "aircraft". )

NOTE: Vimana only provides search, info ,install commmands currently.
